[reading_and_recording_eyetracking.py](ROI-COMP-Eyetracking\reading_and_recording_eyetracking.py) is a script constructed in the coder view. Then, it cannot be used with the builder because the builder can change its code. Though, this code is working and can be perfectly used in further implementation with other components.

[words-area-segmentation.psyexp](ROI-COMP-Eyetracking\words-area-segmentation.psyexp) is a .psyexp file, that is a file from Psychopy Builder View. Here, I tried to merge what I did in the coder inside the builder. I made it because it's going to be easier for the future, when applying other components.

> So, why did I kept the first file? So, there's a single line in the first file that can make a huge difference as well it can be a very simple thing. As I'm still working on this, I preferred keeping both of them. :p
